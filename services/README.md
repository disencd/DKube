a Service acts as a stable network endpoint for a set of pods, enabling communication between different applications and external clients. It provides a consistent IP address and DNS name, regardless of whether the underlying pods are replaced or scaled. Services abstract away the transient nature of pods, making it easier for applications to connect to each other and to external users.
